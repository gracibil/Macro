# Macro
A simple keyboard/mouse macro - WIP
A simple macro for automating tedious tasks on computers, supports mouse and keyboard actions.
The macro uses the pynput library for manipulating mouse and keyboard inputs, it records inputs and saves them in .csv file format, which is then unpacked and used for replicating the actions. The GUI is built using the tkinter library, the GUI supports dynamically adding new elements through a double linked list algorithm which allows for adding/deleting new macros and elements called "widgets" used for them. 
The project is a work in progress.
